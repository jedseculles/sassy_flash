h1. PrettyFlash

Rails 3.0.x plugin that provides "pretty" flash messages. Base code are from Ryan Heath's <a src='http://github.com/rpheath/pretty_flash'>PrettyFlash</a>.

h2. How to install...

<pre><code>$ rails plugin install git@github.com:jedssp/pretty_flash.git</code></pre>

h2. In the controller...

This plugin gives a couple of convenience methods for setting flash messages.

<pre><code>notice "Hooray! You did something good."
warning "Uhm, You're not allowed to do that yet."
error "Ooooops! Something went wrong."
alert "Errr. This is really wrong."</code></pre>

Passing :notice => ‘This is a flash message’ or alert: ‘Something went wrong’ (works only for Ruby 1.9.x) to the format call inside a respond_to block or the flash[] hash will work too.

h2. In the view...

Then all you have to do to display them is:

<pre><code><%= display_flash_messages %></code></pre>

Easy enough?

h2. Get Started

There's an assets folder with this plugin, that contains the images, CSS, and javascript (optional). There's a rake task that installs this stuff where it needs to be (inside the public/ directory).

<pre><code>$ rake pretty_flash:install
</code></pre>

Also, there is an option to pass javascript library argument when running this rake task.

<pre><code>$ rake pretty_flash:install[jquery]
$ rake pretty_flash:install[prototype]</code></pre>
  
Right now, this plugin supports prototype and jquery. If you're not using either, feel free to add a code similar to behavior of the existing javascripts and ask for a pull request. ;-)

These javascripts are only used to fade the flash messages after some seconds (defaults to 25 seconds).

Enjoy and have fun!
