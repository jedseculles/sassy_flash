h1. SassyFlash

Rails 3.0.x plugin that provides "sassy" flash messages. Base code are from Ryan Heath's "PrettyFlash":http://github.com/rpheath/pretty_flash.

SassyFlash gives you a default stylish sticky flash messages on top of your page and will fade out in matter of seconds.

h2. How to install...

<pre><code>$ rails plugin install git@github.com:jedssp/sassy_flash.git</code></pre>

h2. In the controller...

This plugin gives a couple of convenience methods for setting flash messages.

<pre><code>notice "Hooray! You did something good."
warning "Uhm, You're not allowed to do that yet."
error "Ooooops! Something went wrong."
alert "Errr. This is really wrong."</code></pre>

Passing <code>:notice => ‘This is a flash message’</code> or <code>alert: ‘Something went wrong’</code> (works only for Ruby 1.9.x) to the format call inside a <code>respond_to</code> block or the <code>flash[]</code> hash will work too.

h2. In the view...

Then all you have to do to display them is:

<pre><code><%= display_flash_messages %></code></pre>

Easy enough?

h2. Get Started

There's an assets folder with this plugin, that contains the images, CSS, and javascript. There's a rake task that installs this stuff where it needs to be (inside the public/ directory).

<pre><code>$ rake sassy_flash:install
</code></pre>

Also, there is an option to pass javascript library argument when running this rake task.

<pre><code>$ rake sassy_flash:install[dojo]
$ rake sassy_flash:install[jquery]
$ rake sassy_flash:install[mootools]
$ rake sassy_flash:install[prototype]</code></pre>
  
Right now, this plugin supports Dojo, jQuery, MooTools, and Prototype. All code are tested on "jsFiddle":http://jsfiddle.net/. If you're not fan of those javascripts, feel free to add a code similar to behavior of those files and ask for a pull request. ;-)

Those javascripts are only used to fade the flash messages after some seconds (defaults to 2.5 seconds).

Enjoy and have fun!
